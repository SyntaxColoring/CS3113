Dependencies
============

You need to have the development versions of these libraries installed:

- SDL2
- GLEW

Building
========

A simple GNU Make makefile is included to automatically build the template.  It's been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.  You might need to tweak the LIBS and CXXFLAGS variables to make it work on other distros.
